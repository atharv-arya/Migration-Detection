# Migration-Detection

This repository contains code and resources for predicting migration patterns based on available demographic, economic, and social data. The project aims to build predictive models that can forecast migration trends to inform policy-making, urban planning, and resource allocation. This project was originally created for practice purposes back in 2020/2021 to deepen knowledge in data science and predictive modeling.
